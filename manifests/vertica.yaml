      The Vertica integration significantly enhances data discovery and observability capabilities for Vertica databases, 
      providing an efficient and powerful solution for users seeking to optimize their data management experience.
      ## Utilizing ODD Collector with Vertica
      To fully harness the potential of OpenDataDiscovery in conjunction with Vertica, 
      users should utilize the [ODD Collector](https://github.com/opendatadiscovery/odd-collector). This dedicated agent relies exclusively on `information_schema` 
      views to access and retrieve vital information about tables and views, including their associated schemas 
      and metadata. By doing so, the ODD Collector ensures a non-intrusive approach that prevents any performance 
      impact on the database.


      > It is essential to understand that since the ODD Collector does not execute additional analytical queries against the actual data, 
      some metrics may not reflect precise values.
      For instance, the `rows_count` metric might provide an estimated number of rows in a table instead of an exact figure
      ## ODD Platform
      To integrate ODD Collector with the ODD Platform, users must first establish a collector entity within the platform by following these steps:

      1. Navigate to the "Management" section and select "Collectors".
      2. Click on the "Add Collector" button to initiate the process.
      3. Input a unique name for the collector and, optionally, provide a namespace to further categorize and organize the entity. Additionally, you may include a brief description to give more context and information about the collector.
      4. Click "Save" to finalize the setup, and take note of the generated token. This token will be required for incorporating it into the ODD Collector's configuration YAML file, ensuring secure communication between the two components.

      ## ODD Collector
      The process of configuring the ODD Collector involves creating and customizing a single, well-structured YAML configuration file

      ````yaml
      # ODD Platform's host URL
      platform_host_url: https://your.odd.platform

      # Default pulling interval in minutes
      default_pulling_interval: 10

      # Collector's specific security token
      token: ""

      plugins:
        - type: vertica
          # Data source's name
          name: vertica_adapter
          # Optional Data source's description
          description: "Vertica sample database"
          # Vertica database name
          database: database
          # Vertica host
          host: host
          # Vertica port
          port: 5433
          # Vertica user
          user: user
          # Vertica user password
          password: password
